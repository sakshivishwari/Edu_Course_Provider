        <p>CSS is the language we use to style a Web page.</p>  <hr>
        <h3 class="headings">What is CSS?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li>
          <li>
            CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,
            paper, or in other media
          </li>
          <li>
            CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web
            pages all at once
          </li>
          <li>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="headings">Why Use CSS?</h3>
        <p>
          CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design,
          layout and variations in display for different devices and screen
          sizes.
        </p>
      
        <h5 class="headings">CSS Example</h5>
        <p>
          body { <br>
             background-color: lightblue; <br>
             } <br>
             h1 { color: white; <br>
                  text-align: center; } <br>
              p { font-family: verdana;<br>
             font-size: 20px; } <br>
        </p>

        <h3 class="headings">CSS Solved a Big Problem</h3>
        <p>
          HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page! <br>

          HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:  <br>
          &lth1&gtThis is a heading&lt/h1&gt    <br>
          
          &ltp&gtThis is a paragraph.&lt/p&gt  <br>
          
          When tags like &ltfont&gt, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. <br>
           Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process. <br>
          
          To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS. <br>
          
          CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!  <br>


        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3 class="headings">CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</h3>
         <p>

          The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.  <br>

          With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
         </p>
         <hr>
         <h3 class="headings">CSS Syntax</h3>
         <p>A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.</p>
         <p>
          <img  class=" css-img"src="https://www.w3schools.com/css/img_selector.gif" alt="css syntax">
         </p>
           <p>
            The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. <br> <br>

            The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. <br> <br>
            
            Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. <br> <br>
            
            Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces. <br>
           </p>
           <h5 class="headings">Example</h5>
           <p>
            In this example all &ltp&gt elements will be center-aligned, with a red text color:  <br>

              p {   <br>
                color: red; <br>
                  text-align: center; <br>
              }
           </p>

           <h5 class="headings">Example Explained</h5>
           <ul>
           <li>p is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: &ltp&gt).</li>
           <li>color is a property, and red is the property value</li>
            <li>text-align is a property, and center is the property value</li>

           </ul>
